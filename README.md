# Machine Learning

This is a collection of simple algorithms used in machine learning. It's main purpose is personal development of programming and version-control skills. 

Right now, the following models are included:

  - A Linear regression object
  - A K-nearest-neighbors classifier

All objects work with numpy arrays as inputs. Models follow scikit-learn's logic, with .fit() and .predict() methods.
